          <h2> Contract </h2>
         
          <p> I, Georgea K. Freitas, agree to abide by the terms in my Fall Semester 2023 web115 with my instructor, D.I von Briesen. </p> </br>
          I understand that all work that I do on my school and personal websites will be publicly available to the world. I will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private. </br>
          I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.
          Signed: Georgea K. Freitas, 17 August 2023.
        </p>
